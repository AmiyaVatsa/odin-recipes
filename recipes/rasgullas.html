<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rasgulla, also known as rasagola, rosogola or rosogolla, is a syrupy dessert popular in the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent. It is made from ball-shaped dumplings of chhena and semolina dough, cooked in light sugar syrup made of sugar. This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>6 cups milk</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
    <li>2 Â½ cups white sugar</li>
    <li>6 cups water</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Bring the milk to a boil in a heavy-bottomed pan till it starts foaming; immediately add the lime juice and stir. It will curdle right away. You should see the milk solids (chenna) separate from the whey. Pour into a colander lined with cheesecloth; rinse the chenna with cold water to get rid of the lime juice. Allow the water to drain completely. </li>
    <li>Gather the muslin cloth edges like a parcel and express as much water as possible; what you now have is soft paneer. Turn the paneer onto a rolling mat or other smooth surface. Knead the paneer well to make a smooth paste. Roll into a ball and divide into 20 equal portions. </li>
    <li> Bring the water to a boil in a pressure cooker; stir the sugar into the boiling water until dissolved.</li>
    <li>Roll each portion of paneer into a smooth ball between your palms, making sure there are no cracks; gently drop the balls into the hot syrup. Secure the lid onto the pressure cooker and bring to pressure. Reduce heat to medium-low and pressure cook for 6 minutes. </li>
    <li>Release the pressure from the cooker while running under water; remove the lid. The rasgullas should be floating on the syrup and have expanded 2 or 3 times in size. Pour the rasgullas and syrup into a bowl. Gently stir the cardamom into the mixture. Refrigerate to chill completely before serving cold. </li>
</ol>
